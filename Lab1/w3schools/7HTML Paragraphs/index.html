The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.

<!--  A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.-->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<!--You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.-->
<!--Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.-->
<!--With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in yourHTML code.-->
<!--The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page isdisplayed:-->
<p>
  This paragraph
  contains a lot of lines
  in the source code,
  but the browser
  ignores it.
</p>

<p>
  This paragraph
  contains         a lot of spaces
  in the source         code,
  but the        browser
  ignores it.
</p>

<!--The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:-->

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>


<!--Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:-->

<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>


<!--This poem will display on a single line:-->
<p>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</p>


<!--The HTML `<pre>` element defines preformatted text.-->

<!--The text inside a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:-->

<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
