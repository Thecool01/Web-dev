    <p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Pour milk over semolina in a bowl. <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Mix semolina with milk and set aside for a while. While we are making cottage cheese, the semolina will swell slightly. <br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> For this casserole, the cottage cheese must be ground through a fine metal sieve. Do it in parts. The softer and fattier the cottage cheese, the easier it is to grind it. This step is very important for a perfectly tender casserole, so don't skip it. <br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> This is what the cottage cheese will look like after grinding - airy, similar to coconut shavings. <br>
        <strong>Step 5: </strong> Turn on the oven and preheat to 170 degrees. Add semolina with milk to the grated cottage cheese. <br>
        <strong>Step 6: </strong> Beat the egg here, add sugar and salt. <br>
        <strong>Step 7: </strong> Stir until a homogeneous curd mass is obtained. <br>
        <strong>Step 8: </strong> Grease the sides and bottom of the baking dish with butter. Place the curd mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. <br>
        <strong>Step 9: </strong> Cook the cottage cheese casserole in a preheated oven at 170 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until golden brown. <br>
        <strong>Step 10: </strong> Let the finished casserole cool. After this, it will hold its shape when cut. Enjoy your meal! <br>

    <h3>Porridge with water</h3>
<p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Before preparing millet porridge, it is advisable to choose cereals that are more yellow in color.
  So, here are the products you will need to prepare millet porridge. <br>
  <strong>Step 2:</strong> Millet cereals must be thoroughly washed with water (5-7 times) and scalded with boiling water. <br>
  <strong>Step 3:</strong> Place the cereal in boiling salted water, add 1 tbsp. spoon of oil and, stirring, cook the porridge over low heat until thickened. If you cook the porridge over too high a heat, the water may boil away before the porridge is ready (15-20 minutes). In this case, you need to add 0.5 cups of hot boiled water. <br>
  <strong>Step 4:</strong> When serving, add the remaining melted butter to the millet porridge and stir.  <br>
</p>

<h3>Porridge with milk</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Step 1: </strong> The prepared cereal must first be boiled in 1-2 glasses of salted water until half cooked, 5-10 minutes (if the cereal is cooked in a large amount of water, drain off the remaining water). Boil the milk. <br>
  <strong>Step 2: </strong> After this, pour in hot milk, add butter and sugar. <br>
  <strong>Step 3: </strong> Cook the porridge until thickened. Then the millet porridge can be put in the oven. <br>
  <strong>Step 4: </strong> You can serve millet milk porridge with fruit or chocolate. <br>
  <strong>Step 5: </strong> For liquid millet porridge, take 4-5 glasses of water or milk for 1 glass of cereal. Enjoy your meal! <br>

<p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> To bake cupcakes we will need molds and paper cups. <br>
  <strong>Step 2:</strong> Mix semolina with milk and set aside for a while. While we are making cottage cheese, the semolina will swell slightly. <br>
  <strong>Step 3:</strong> Sift 220 g of flour with 5 g of baking powder into a bowl (you can sift the flour 2 times). <br>
  <strong>Step 4:</strong> Place 120g soft butter in a mixer bowl. Beat until the butter turns white. Without stopping whisking, add 200 g of sugar. Continue beating some more. <br>
  <strong>Step 5: </strong> Continuing to beat, add 2 eggs and 5 g of vanilla sugar one by one. Beat until the mixture turns white. While beating, remove the mixture from the sides and stir until the dough is homogeneous. <br>
  <strong>Step 6: </strong> Then the mixer rotation speed should be reduced to minimum, add flour and 120 ml of milk. Flour and milk should be added one at a time in three additions. <br>
  <strong>Step 7: </strong> Using a pastry bag, mechanical ice cream scoop, or regular tablespoon, scoop the batter into paper cups (they should be 2/3 full). <br>
  <strong>Step 8: </strong> Bake cupcakes in a preheated oven. The temperature at which cupcakes need to be baked is 180°C. Time - approximately 20 minutes. You can check readiness with a wooden stick. Remove the finished cupcakes from the oven, let them cool slightly, then place them on a wire rack or board without removing them from the paper cups and let them cool completely. <br>
  <strong>Step 9: </strong> Homemade milk cupcakes are ready. Ready baked goods can be decorated with cream.<br>
